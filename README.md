# Purchase-Agreement

In this purchase agreement, a buyer and seller are involved in a transaction whereby the buyer and seller both submit a deposit in order to complete the transaction. This protects the buyer and seller. 

When the seller "lists" and item for sale, they deposit the price of the item which is then locked by the smart contract, at this stage the buyer can choose to abort. When a buyer wishes to purchase the item, they would have to pay double the price of the item, which includes the deposit. Once the buyer confirms they have received the item, they will receive their deposit back. Only after that can the seller withdraw the payment from the smart contract. 

This system protexts both the buyer and the seller by making sure the item has been sent and is in good condition, as well as making sure payment has been made.
